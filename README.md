## About
Welcome to my Earbuds Store â€“ your gateway to premium audio. Discover a symphony of sound, cutting-edge features, and style. Explore the perfect blend of technology and design to enhance your audio journey.

## Nav Bar and Footer
On this site I have created a navigation bar that is fully functional and helps website visitors to quickly and comfortably navigate through the site. And also a footer that contains all the necessary links. Everything works well on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Functionality
On this site you can find a number of different animations, xray model, ar model and contact form. I am also trying to create an animation that will consist of multiple jpg images, which should eventually form a scrolling animation on a web page. But for the moment I have set placeholder as the work is not finished yet and needs more time.

## Colors
Website's color palette is a perfect blend of elegance, trust, simplicity, and sophistication. Black symbolizes elegance, blue instills trust, white exudes simplicity, and dark grey adds sophistication. Together, these colors create a visually appealing and stylish web design that appeals to a wide audience."

## Creator
This website is done by Viktor Kim, Interactive Media Design student at Fanshawe College.
